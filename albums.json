But as always with this project, getting the majority of inspiration and influence from nature, in particular the Norwegian scenery that surrounds me.\n\nThe title means in Norwegian \"endless ocean\". Referring to the vast oceans and the feeling/state of mind that arises in me near the ocean, especially these views where the ocean seems to go on endlessly.\n\nReleased March 24, 2023",

Although being far from peak time monsters, the aim here is undoubtedly to entrance a focused dancefloor, preferably while the sun is rising. Whether it’s the Eden-like atmosphere of “Cascade”, the introverted broken beats of “Infinite” or the meaty trance of “Pathos” that will guide the crowd through the morning session is only a matter of circumstances and taste.\n\nReleased October 23, 2023 on Navigare Audio",
